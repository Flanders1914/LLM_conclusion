Aflatoxin is a substance produced by food mold that is known to cause HCC in experimental animals. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship of p53 gene mutation to high or low levels of aflatoxin in the diet and to HBV infection. p53 protein and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) were evaluated by immunohistochemistry using the avidin-biotin-peroxidase system in paraffin-embedded specimens of HCC and of adjacent nontumorous liver tissue from 43 patients. Tissue specimens from three normal human livers were also evaluated. HCCs and adjacent nontumorous liver tissues were obtained from 23 patients from Qidong, China, where aflatoxin levels in the diet are high, and from 20 patients from two regions in the United States (patients from the National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md., and Kuakini Medical Center, Honolulu, Hawaii), where aflatoxin levels in the diet are low. Mutant p53 protein was detected in the nuclei of HCCs from 14 (61%) of 23 patients from China and from three (30%) of 10 patients and six (60%) of 10 patients, respectively, from the two regions of the United States. A statistically significant association between detection of mutant p53 protein in HCC cells and the detection of HBsAg in hepatocytes of the adjacent nontumorous liver tissue was observed in patients from China and the United States considered together.\n\nMake a scientific conclusion based on the given text above:assistant\n\nMutant p53 protein was detected in HCC cells from 30% to 60% of patients from the United States, as well as from China, and was associated with HBV infection in the adjacent nontumorous liver tissue. These findings suggest that p53 mutation is a common genetic change in HCC and that the association of p53 mutation with HBV infection may be a common feature of HCC worldwide.", "answer": "Mutations of the tumor suppressor gene p53 in hepatocellular carcinomas are not limited to patients from geographic regions where the ingestion of aflatoxin is high. In many patients, these mutations may be associated with HBV infection. The possible interaction of chronic HBV infection and p53 gene mutation, suggested by these data, indicates a mechanism by which HBV infection beginning early in life could contribute to the subsequent development of HCC."}

CD43 expression was studied in 131 immunophenotypically defined B cell lymphomas, including lymphocytic lymphoma (Lc, n = 13), centrocytic lymphoma (Cc, n = 14), and a range of follicle centre cell lymphomas (FCC) including centroblastic/centrocytic follicular (CbCcF, n = 48), centroblastic diffuse (CbD, n = 39), centroblastic/centrocytic diffuse (CbCcD, n = 4), centroblastic follicular and diffuse (Cb FD, n = 3) and centroblastic/centrocytic follicular and diffuse (CbCc FD, n = 1). Nine lymphomas of mucosa associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) were also examined. Epitope blocking studies showed that WR14 is a CD43 reagent that binds to an epitope identical with or close to that recognised by MT1. Eleven of 13 (84%) cases of Lc and 11 of 14 (78%) cases of Cc expressed CD43; 87 of 95 (91%) cases of FCC did not. All eight low grade lymphomas of MALT were negative. One high grade lymphoma, transformed from a low grade MALT lymphoma, was positive for CD43. The expression of CD43 by tumours of B cell lineage was associated with the expression of CD5 (p < 0.001) although either antigen could occasionally be found in the absence of the other.\n\nMake a scientific conclusion based on the given text above:assistant\n\nCD43 is expressed in Lc and Cc, but not in FCC or MALT lymphomas.

After the cranial surface was exposed, a 3-mm hole was drilled 2 mm caudal and 1.5 mm lateral with respect to lambda for placement of a 1-microns tungsten microelectrode. Cells of the NTS were located 6-6.5 mm from the brain surface, and CFR was continuously recorded. Lead II electrocardiogram and arterial blood pressure were also recorded. Twenty-four animals received either d- or l-bupivacaine (2 mg/kg) in random order. Cell firing rates decreased from 21 +/- 13 to 0 +/- 0 impulses/second (p < 0.001) at 34 +/- 15 seconds after the injection of d-bupivacaine. Cell firing rates decreased from 22 +/- 17 to 2 +/- 4 impulses/second (p < 0.01) at 68 +/- 45 seconds after injection of l-bupivacaine. In addition to the decreases in blood pressure and heart rate that were found, all animals exhibited an inversion in electrical axis beginning within 2-3 seconds after bupivacaine administration.

Naloxone administration to patients with anorexia nervosa in the weight loss phase, did not significantly modify their serum LH levels nor the characteristics of its pulsatile secretion. Administration of the opioid blocker induced a significant increase in serum LH concentrations only in those patients in ideal body weight and amenorrhoea who resumed ovulatory cycles within the 6 months following the last study as well as in patients with an ideal body weight and ovulatory cycles and in normal controls. All patients and subjects who responded to naloxone administration exhibited significant increases in the area under the LH curve, mean LH pulse amplitude and peak area. Patients in ideal body weight and amenorrhoea who did not resume ovulatory cycles within the 6 months following the study days, did not respond to naloxone administration. There were no significant correlations between the magnitude of LH response to naloxone administration and the baseline levels of serum oestradiol and progesterone. All patients exhibited significant pituitary LH responses to both GnRH doses, regardless of the stage of the disease; however, the pituitary responsiveness shown by patients in ideal body weight was significantly higher than that presented by patients in weight loss. There were no significant differences between the responses to GnRH exhibited by patients in ideal body weight and amenorrhoea who responded to naloxone administration and those shown by patients in the same clinical condition but who were insensitive to opioid blockade.\n\nMake a scientific conclusion based on the given text above:assistant\n\nOur data show that the pituitary GnRH responsiveness and the pituitary LH reserve are preserved in patients with anorexia nervosa. The recovery of the hypothalamic-opioid activity involved in LH secretion is a late event occurring after the resumption of ovulatory cycles.", "answer": "The re-establishment of hypothalamic-opioid inhibitory activity involved in LH secretion in patients with anorexia nervosa during the phase of weight gain predicts imminent restoration of ovulatory cycles. Pituitary LH response to exogenous GnRH during weight recovery does not accurately predict the outcome of the disease regarding reinitiation of menstrual cycles; however, it might be an indicator that the normal function of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis is being restored."}

{"input": "Cardiac troponin T is a regulatory contractile protein not normally found in blood. Its detection in the circulation has been shown to be a sensitive and specific marker for myocardial cell damage. We used a newly developed enzyme immunoassay for troponin T to determine whether its presence in the serum of patients with unstable angina was a prognostic indicator. We screened 109 patients with unstable angina (25 with accelerated or subacute angina and 84 with acute angina at rest) for serum creatine kinase activity, creatine kinase isoenzyme MB activity, and troponin T every eight hours for two days after admission to the hospital. The outcomes of interest during the hospitalization were death and myocardial infarction. Troponin T was detected (range, 0.20 to 3.64 micrograms per liter; mean, 0.78; median, 0.50) in the serum of 33 of the 84 patients (39 percent) with acute angina at rest. Only three of these patients had elevated creatine kinase MB activity (two were positive for troponin T, and one was negative). Of the 33 patients who were positive for troponin T, 10 (30 percent) had myocardial infarction (3 after coronary-artery bypass surgery), and 5 of these died during hospitalization.

Animals (n = 24) were anaesthetised, subjected to a left thoracotomy, and the left anterior descending coronary artery was isolated. Measurements of segmental shortening and monophasic action potential were taken before drug, after drug, during a 15 min occlusion, and at times following reperfusion. Cromakalim significantly improved reperfusion recovery of function. Both preischaemic and postischaemic myocardial blood flows were increased with cromakalim, although there was no significant change in collateral blood flow during ischaemia relative to vehicle. In the absence of ischaemia, cromakalim reduced APD95 by 8%. There was no change in APD95 with vehicle alone. During coronary occlusion, cromakalim significantly reduced APD95 by 27% as compared with 8% in the vehicle group.

{"input": "The aim was to assess the effects of various antiarrhythmic drugs on 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) induced outward current (IDNP), presumably the ATP sensitive K+ current (IK,ATP) of isolated cardiac cells and to discuss mechanisms involved in the hypoglycaemia which occurs in patients on these drugs. The quasi-steady state current-voltage relationship from the isolated guinea pig ventricular cells was measured using whole cell voltage clamp techniques with a ramp pulse programme. The effects of seven different antiarrhythmic drugs on IDNP were examined. Action potentials were elicited at a rate of 0.2 Hz by an intracellular current injection. DNP (50 mumol.litre-1) increased the quasi-steady state outward current at potentials positive to about -60 mV. This current (IDNP) was completely inhibited by the subsequent application of glibenclamide (1 mumol.litre-1), thereby suggesting that the IDNP is probably IK,ATP. Cibenzoline (10 mumol.litre-1, class Ia), disopyramide (30 mumol.litre-1, class Ia), and procainamide (100 mumol.litre-1, class Ia) significantly inhibited the IDNP by 95.5(SD 11.3)%, 77.8(21.2)%, and 76.4(23.9)% respectively. Flecainide (class 1c) inhibited the IDNP by 66.9(23.9)% at 10 mumol.litre-1 but not at 2 mumol.litre-1.

The quasi-steady state current-voltage relationship from the isolated guinea pig ventricular cells was measured using whole cell voltage clamp techniques with a ramp pulse programme. The effects of seven different antiarrhythmic drugs on IDNP were examined. Action potentials were elicited at a rate of 0.2 Hz by an intracellular current injection.

Nine-hundred twenty five patients were evaluated after a mean of 10 days from an acute myocardial infarction and followed up for a mean of 14 months. During DET, one major adverse reaction occurred, consisting of a prolonged ischemia resistant to aminophylline and nitrates, and progressing to small uncomplicated reinfarction. In 11 patients the lower dipyridamole dose (0.56 mg/kg over 4') gave limiting side effects. Patients were followed up for 14 +/- 9.9 months (range = 1.53). During the follow-up, there were 34 deaths and 37 non-fatal myocardial infarctions; 104 patients developed class III or IV angina, and 149 had coronary revascularization procedures (bypass or angioplasty).

{"input": "This review will focus on aspects of the postconcussion syndrome (PCS), including accompanying symptomatology, neuropsychological changes, brain imaging studies and treatment. In each topic area, those research studies resulting in the most interpretable data are reported. Since there is little research in some aspects of the PCS, some studies of limited merit are described, with their limitations outlined, in lieu of not reporting any study. The section on psychopharmacology largely consists of opinions of recognized clinicians, since there is almost no research on the psychopharmacology of PCS. Mild traumatic brain injury is a relatively frequent occurrence which often results in the postconcussion syndrome (PCS), consisting of complaints of irritability, fatigue, headache, difficulty concentrating, dizziness, and memory problems. Anxiety and depression are also frequently present, especially later in its course.

In each topic area, those research studies resulting in the most interpretable data are reported. Since there is little research in some aspects of the PCS, some studies of limited merit are described, with their limitations outlined, in lieu of not reporting any study. The section on psychopharmacology largely consists of opinions of recognized clinicians, since there is almost no research on the psychopharmacology of PCS. Mild traumatic brain injury is a relatively frequent occurrence which often results in the postconcussion syndrome (PCS), consisting of complaints of irritability, fatigue, headache, difficulty concentrating, dizziness, and memory problems. Anxiety and depression are also frequently present, especially later in its course.

The frequent occurrence of dilation of both periaortic lymphatic vessels and lymph node sinuses, even in \"incipient\" aneurysms, supports the hypothesis that it may be the lymphatic stasis which determines periaortic fibrosis. Finally, atherosclerotic components passing into periaortic fibrosis and eliciting granulomatous reaction were observed in two Group I cases featuring prominent \"inflammatory\" symptoms; such a finding favours the hypothesis that an immune reaction against some components of the atherosclerotic plaque may lead to the pronounced inflammatory response that is peculiar of inflammatory aneurysms."}

Between March 1990 and July 1991, we performed percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy in 54 patients. The primary sites of tumour were the hypopharynx (11), oral cavity (7), tongue (7), cricopharynx (7), oesophagus (16) and other sites (6). The indications were difficulty in swallowing following treatment (22), preoperative nutritional support (7) and terminal care (21). In 49 patients, it was performed by the 'pull' technique in the endoscopy room under local anaesthesia and mild sedation. Indigenously prepared tubes and blenderised foods were used. Fifteen patients underwent dilatation of the tumour prior to the gastrostomy. The procedure was successful in 50 (93%) patients. Three failures were caused by obstructing tumours and one by a previous gastric resection. Feeding was started 18 to 24 hours after the procedure in 48 patients.

Changes in (1) the prevalence and distribution of asthma, and (2) among children with asthma, the percentage of children hospitalized, days spent in bed, school days lost in the year prior to survey, and parent ratings and reports of children's overall health status and behavior problems. The estimated prevalence of childhood asthma increased from 3.1% in 1981 to 4.3% in 1988 (P <.0001), with similar increases for children, adolescents, and both sexes. Increases occurred among white children (2.7% to 4.1%; P <.0001) but not black children (5.3% vs 5.1%; not significant). Among those with asthma in 1988 compared with 1981, there was better overall health status (11% vs 24% fair/poor; P <.0001) and fewer with 30 or more days spent in bed in the last year (3.9% vs 7.2%; P <.04).

One of the most important of these late effects is the development of second malignant neoplasms (SMNs), which occur in approximately 8% of children within 20 years of diagnosis of a malignancy. These secondary cancers may result (individually or in combination) from increased genetic susceptibility, the mutagenic effects of chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy, or chance. Whereas the development of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) as an SMN is a well-recognized phenomenon, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has been infrequently described as an SMN in either adults or children. We report three patients treated at our institution in whom ALL developed as an SMN after treatment for neuroblastoma, Wilms' tumor, and Hodgkin's disease. These cases prompted us to review the published literature for cases of secondary ALL in childhood. Patients whose initial malignancy was diagnosed at age less than 16 years were classified as pediatric patients.

{"input": "Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is more sensitive to anticancer agents than non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but few studies have analyzed the mechanisms of natural drug resistance responsible for this difference. To elucidate these mechanisms, we determined drug sensitivity and evaluated the biochemical parameters affecting response to the DNA topoisomerase II inhibitors doxorubicin and etoposide in both types of cancer cell lines, in particular the activity and content of DNA topoisomerase II, as well as etoposide uptake and cell doubling time. Drug sensitivity and cellular uptake of etoposide were determined by clonogenic assay and accumulation of radiolabeled drug, respectively. The topoisomerase II activity was assayed by decatenation of kinetoplast DNA to minicircle DNA using nuclear protein, and the content was determined by immunoblot analysis of nuclear extracts. We also compared the topoisomerase II content in parent cell lines with that in lines with cisplatin resistance acquired in vitro. Sensitivities to doxorubicin and etoposide were higher in SCLC cell lines than in NSCLC lines, and the difference was statistically significant. Etoposide uptake in SCLC cells was higher than in NSCLC cells; the difference was statistically significant, but this difference may not be sufficient to account for the variation in sensitivities of the cell lines. Topoisomerase II activities of nuclear protein from SCLC cell lines were reproducibly twofold higher than those for NSCLC cell lines. The topoisomerase II content in nuclear protein appeared to be higher in SCLC cell lines than in NSCLC cell lines and corresponded to the sensitivities to doxorubicin and etoposide. In the cisplatin-resistant NSCLC cell lines PC-7/CDDP and PC-14/CDDP, the topoisomerase II content was increased compared with that in the parent lines, but the topoisomerase II content in other cisplatin-sensitive parent lines was similar to that in resistant sublines.\n\nMake a scientific conclusion based on the given text above:", "output": "The higher topoisomerase II activity and content in SCLC cells may be one of the major factors responsible for the higher sensitivity of SCLC cells to doxorubicin and etoposide.", "output_with_context": "user\n\nSmall-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is more sensitive to anticancer agents than non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but few studies have analyzed the mechanisms of natural drug resistance responsible for this difference.

The diagnosis of acquired vWD can be made on the basis of a history of bleeding, a prolonged BT, and a low RCoF activity. The vWF multimer analysis is useful in differentiating the two types of acquired vWD. The incidence of acquired vWD in children with Wilms' tumor is higher than previously reported.

The vWF multimer analysis is useful in differentiating the two types of acquired vWD.", "answer": "The incidence of acquired vWD in association with Wilms' tumor merits further study through a large prospective trial. Such a trial should include careful family and clinical bleeding histories plus measurement of a platelet count, BT, coagulant FVIII and vWF levels, RCoF activity, and vWF multimer analysis. The response to 1-desamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin (DDAVP) should be tested in all patients with Wilms' tumor and acquired vWD, including patients with a type III profile, before an invasive procedure is performed. Successful use of DDAVP may avoid exposure of affected patients to blood products."}

The treponemes from 5-day infections were immobilised significantly more slowly than treponemes from 7- and 8-day infections. Compared with NRS, pre-incubations with a high-titred, low-titred and \"autologous\" serum resulted in significantly more rapid immobilisation of the treponemes. With most other animal sera resistance to immobilisation was slight compared with that produced by NRS. Immunofluorescent studies revealed that the treponemes were covered with a layer of the human third complement factor (C3b), within an hour of incubation. With two sequential pre-incubations, a delay of the immobilisation was only noted in those test mixtures in which NRS had been present in both preincubations.\n\nMake a scientific conclusion based on the given text above:assistant\n\nThese findings suggest that the treponemes are protected from rapid immobilisation by a serum factor which is inactivated by heat. The factor is a heat-labile, dose-dependent, serum component which is present in rabbit serum, but not in other animal sera. The factor is a C3b component. The results are discussed in relation to the possible role of C3b in the pathogenesis of syphilis.", "answer": "Rabbit serum delays the rapid in vitro immobilisation of Percoll purified treponemes by normal human serum. There was no evidence that this was caused by preventing access of antibodies (in vivo as well as in vitro) to, or preventing the activation of complement on, the treponemal surface. The evidence points to a mechanism in the fluid phase, suggesting participation of a third factor in the immobilisation process, for instance an enzyme, which can be partially inhibited by rabbit serum component(s)."}

The pattern of arrhythmias provoked by acute pressure changes can be altered by altering electrolyte concentrations.", "answer": "Left ventricular hypertrophy plays a paradoxical role in the development of arrhythmias in this model. It appears to protect the heart from developing arrhythmias in response to sudden pressure changes when electrolyte concentrations are normal. However, it also seems to lead to a marked increase in the sensitivity of the myocardium to pressure changes during perfusion with low levels of potassium and magnesium. Under these conditions, potentially fatal arrhythmias can be readily provoked by relatively small pressure changes. These results may be of importance for the management of hypertension and may provide insight into some of the mechanisms underlying sudden death in hypertension. The findings may also be of relevance to other cardiac diseases associated with ventricular hypertrophy or abnormal wall stress."}

Juvenile five- to nine-week-old male mice CD-1 type (Charles River Canada Limited). Infection with coxsackie B3 enterovirus. Pretreatment with cyclophosphamide two days and 4 h before inoculation of 0.2 or 0.15 mg/g. Animals were killed seven, nine, 28 and 63 days post infection. Following cyclophosphamide conditioning, a tissue response infection with CVB3 was uniformly observed. Virus, however, was infrequently recovered from the myocardium whereas myocarditis became chronic after 28 days.\n\nMake a scientific conclusion based on the given text above:assistant\n\nA mouse model of coxsackievirus B3 myocarditis has been developed. The model is reproducible and may be useful in the study of the immunologic and pathologic mechanisms of myocarditis.", "answer": "Pretreatment of juvenile mice with cyclophosphamide results in a reproducible model of viral myocarditis with chronic changes in the myocardium."}

Oxytocin (0.1 nM) causes a statistically significant dose-related decrease in cAMP when combined with 1 nM corticotrophin-releasing factor (P less than 0.001), as compared with cAMP stimulation by corticotrophin-releasing factor alone. Time course studies suggest a maximal effect at 1 minute. The hypothesis that an intracellular reduction of cAMP is a prerequisite for the synergistic response in contraction force was tested with tension recordings. Prevention of a decrease in cAMP in the tissue by addition of 10 nM forskolin to the superfusate abolished the potentiation between oxytocin and corticotrophin-releasing factor.\n\nMake a scientific conclusion based on the given text above:assistant\n\nThe synergistic effect of oxytocin and corticotrophin-releasing factor on human myometrial contractility is associated with a decrease in cAMP. The decrease in cAMP may be a necessary step for the synergistic response.", "answer": "These results indicate that a fall in cAMP concentration plays a vital mediating role in the synergistic interaction between oxytocin and corticotrophin-releasing factor."}

After excluding 33 women, 51 who had been managed in accordance with the described protocol and had the presence of CIGN confirmed by central review of diagnostic histopathological material were included in the study. INTERVENTION/PROTOCOL: Women with CIGN diagnosed on a cervical cone specimen were managed in accordance with a specific protocol: (a) women with negative cone margins were managed conservatively and followed up with regular cervical cytological and colposcopic examinations; (b) women with involved cone margins were managed by hysterectomy. Presence or absence of CIGN at cone margins, results of cervical cytological examinations following conization, results of histopathological assessment of any surgical specimens taken after initial cone biopsy. Of the 51 women with confirmed CIGN, managed by conization, 14 (27%) were aged 30 or less and 15 (29%) were nulliparous. Thirty five women who had a cone biopsy showing margins free of CIGN have been managed by conization alone. After a median follow-up period of 12 months there is no apparent residual CIGN or invasive disease in this group.

False positivity from the acetic acid test occurs and is mainly due to inflammatory conditions but also to the presence of other conditions. Epithelial fissures are evidently associated with some subclinical GPVI lesions and may potentially represent loci minores for infectious stimuli and perhaps facilitate the transmission of some blood-borne STDs. We prose that the term \"papillomavirus balanoposthitis\" should be used for penile HPV infection associated with inflammatory responses. Our study indicates that PIN III frequently occurs in a subclinical form and may be associated with not only previously identified \"high-risk\" HPV types such as type 16, but also with the HPV type 42 that has not previously been considered as oncogenic."}

Small arteries were dissected from gluteal subcutaneous biopsies and mounted on a wire-myograph. Blood vessels were measured and dose-response curves to different agents tested. The external diameter of blood vessels of the hypertensive patients tended to be smaller and the width of their media tended to be thicker, but the cross-sectional area of the wall was similar in both groups. Lumen diameters were significantly smaller in hypertensives and the media:lumen ratio was significantly increased in hypertensive patients. Active tension responses and sensitivity to norepinephrine, arginine vasopressin and angiotensin II were similar in both groups, but calculated active pressure responses were enhanced in hypertensives due to the smaller blood vessel lumen. Tension responses to endothelin-1 at increasing concentrations of 0.1 to 100 nmol/l were lower in hypertensive patients, but the calculated transmural active pressure developed was not significantly different at or above 10 nmol/l.\n\nMake a scientific conclusion based on the given text above:assistant\n\nThe results indicate that the response of human resistance arteries to endothelin is altered in essential hypertensive patients. These findings suggest that endothelin may play a role in the pathogenesis of human hypertension.", "answer": "These results suggest that gluteal subcutaneous small resistance arteries of male essential hypertensive patients exhibit a decrement in responsiveness to endothelin-1. The altered design of the hypertensive blood vessels enhanced calculated pressure responses, which may contribute to the maintenance of elevated blood pressure."}

Eight of 40 patients had primary mediastinal germ cell tumors with no complete remissions and a median survival of 2 months (range, 0.5 to 9.0 months).\n\nMake a scientific conclusion based on the given text above:assistant\n\nHigh-dose carboplatin and etoposide is active in patients with recurrent or refractory germ cell tumors, particularly those resistant to cisplatin. Although the complete response rate is only 30%, 15% of patients remain in complete remission for at least 24 months. The site of the primary tumor is an important prognostic factor.", "answer": "Treatment with high-dose carboplatin and etoposide in conjunction with autologous bone marrow rescue in patients with relapsed or refractory germ cell tumors is a potentially curative therapeutic option, even for heavily pretreated or cisplatin-refractory patients. Some degree of disease resistance to cisplatin can be overcome with dose escalation of platinum compounds. Patients with multiple recurrences of relapsed or refractory primary mediastinal germ cell tumors were not helped by this approach."}
{"input": "To review the chemistry, antimicrobial spectrum, pharmacokinetics, clinical trials, adverse effects, and drug interactions of four new macrolide antibiotics: azithromycin, clarithromycin, dirithromycin, and roxithromycin.

Our purpose was to examine whether increased levels of murine TIMP-1 can directly suppress the invasive ability of malignant cells. Murine B16-F10 melanoma cells were transfected with an expression vector to overproduce TIMP-1. Among these transfectants, we isolated five clonal cell lines (2-5, 2-8, 2-10, 6-5, and 6-9) that showed upregulation (i.e., overexpression) of TIMP-1. These cell lines had an increased basal level of TIMP-1 messenger RNA. TIMP-1 expression was under the control of the mouse metallothionein-I promoter, and four of these five clones (2-5, 2-8, 6-5, and 6-9) showed a threefold to 10-fold induction of TIMP-1 message when they were treated with 20 microM cadmium for 4 hours. An increase in TIMP-1 message led to an increase in TIMP-1 protein activity measured in the conditioned medium of clones 2-10 and 6-5. The invasive ability of the TIMP-1-upregulated cells was tested in a matrigel transwell invasion assay.

The patient died approximately 2 months after the recurrent tumor was detected.\n\nMake a scientific conclusion based on the given text above:assistant\n\nEBV is associated with LG. The virus may play a role in the pathogenesis of LG. The clonal nature of the recurrent tumor suggests that LG may be a more malignant disease than previously suspected.", "answer": "This case demonstrated the development of a primary cerebellar B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder, histologically identical to lymphomatoid granulomatosis, that transformed into a lymphoma. The original tumor and the subsequent lymphoma contained, on average, several copies of EBV-related DNA per cell. Despite an extensive survey of the patient, no immune deficit was detected. Interpretation of the literature with the results of this case suggest that this instance of primary cerebellar LG arose as a consequence of an unusual EBV-associated B-cell lymphoproliferation. It is suggested that EBV may be a significant factor in the initiation of the abnormal proliferations of T-cells or B-cells reported in this disorder."}

Intracellular Na+ and K+ were measured by flame photometry and Mg+ and Ca+ by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Cell membrane ATPase activity was determined by a colorimetric method. The hypertensive group consistently demonstrated depressed activity of each ATPase studied, with significantly lower serum Mg2+, serum K+, erythrocyte Mg2+ and platelet Mg2+ levels compared with the normotensive group. Platelet Na+ and Ca2+ and erythrocyte Ca2+ were significantly elevated in the hypertensive group. In the hypertensive group, mean arterial pressure (MAP) was inversely correlated with platelet and erythrocyte membrane Na+,K(+)-ATPase, Ca(2+)-ATPase and Mg(2+)-ATPase. Serum Mg2+, serum Ca2+ and platelet Mg2+ were negatively correlated with MAP in the hypertensive group whilst erythrocyte and platelet Ca2+ were positively correlated. In the normotensive group, platelet Mg2+ and MAP were negatively, and erythrocyte Ca2+ and MAP, positively correlated.\n\nMake a scientific conclusion based on the given text above:assistant\n\nThe depressed ATPase activity and the abnormalities in intracellular cations in the hypertensive group suggest that a defect in ion transport and membrane function may be involved in the pathogenesis of essential hypertension.", "answer": "Black patients with essential hypertension have widespread depression of cell membrane Na+,K(+)-ATPase, Ca(2+)-ATPase and Mg(2+)-ATPase activities with serum and intracellular Mg2+ depletion and cytosolic Na+ and Ca2+ overload, which may reflect an underlying membrane abnormality in essential hypertension. These cellular abnormalities may be related to the defective transport mechanisms that in turn may be aggravated by Mg2+ depletion."}

Healthy women with ovulatory cycles (hospital personnel, n = 8) and women affected by PCOD (n = 32) were studied on day 5 to 6 of their follicular phase. All women had an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) (75 g) on day 5 to 6 of the cycle. Then plasma samples were collected at 7.00 A.M.; at 11.00 P.M., 2 mg of dexamethasone (DEX) were orally administered with blood samples collected the day after at 7.00 A.M. (effect of DEX). Then adenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH, Synacten; Ciba-Geigy, Varese, Italy) 250 micrograms was injected intravenously (IV) and samples collected 60 minutes later (effect of ACTH). Plasma glucose and insulin concentration were assayed on OGTT samples collected at time 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, and 240 minutes after glucose ingestion. Data are expressed as area under the curve. Cortisol, 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP), testosterone (T), androstenedione (A), and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS) plasma levels were evaluated on the samples collected before and after DEX or ACTH administration. Data are expressed as absolute concentrations and percent increase in respect to values before the treatment. According to the OGTT response, 21 patients were classified as hyperinsulinemic and 11 as normoinsulinemic. The ideal body weight was greater in hyperinsulinemic patients. No differences in baseline hormone levels were found between the two groups. Only sex hormone binding globulin levels were significantly greater in normoinsulinemic patients (P less than 0.05). Also, the plasma concentration of all steroids after DEX were similar in both groups. Intravenous injection of ACTH significantly increased plasma androgens levels. Cortisol, DHEAS, and T enhancement did not differ in normoinsulinemic and hyperinsulinemic patients, whereas significantly greater A (P less than 0.01) and 17-OHP (P less than 0.05) plasma concentrations were observed after ACTH injection in hyperinsulinemic when compared with normoinsulinemic PCOD subjects. Control group after IV ACTH showed an increase of A and 17-OHP similar to those found in normoinsulinemic PCOD group.\n\nMake a scientific conclusion based on the given text above:assistant\n\nThe data obtained suggest that adrenal androgens are more responsive to ACTH stimulation in hyperinsulinemic PCOD patients.", "answer": "These data suggest that insulin could be involved in the androgen production by adrenal gland and it could influence the responsiveness of adrenal to its trophic hormones."}

An abnormality of the sympathetic nervous system has been suspected because of the slow heart rates observed and the common precipitation of syncope by adrenergic stimulation (exercise or fright). The characteristic QT prolongation and torsade de pointes arrhythmias suggest a potassium ion (K+) abnormality.

Significantly fewer of these women developed high grade dyskaryosis (13/98 (13%) v 88/339 (26%), p less than 0.05).\n\nMake a scientific conclusion based on the given text above:assistant\n\nIn women aged 20 to 39 with borderline cytological changes on routine cervical cytology screening there is a high risk of progression to high grade dyskaryosis. Such women should be offered more frequent screening and possibly colposcopy.", "answer": "Women with borderline smear test results are at increased risk of developing high grade dyskaryosis, particularly if the borderline changes occur without cytological features of human papillomavirus infection. Progression occurs within three years in 50% of cases, although a linearly increasing risk was sustained over the nine years of follow up and was greatest in women aged 20 to 39. Careful follow up of these women is indicated."}

The patients were linked in that they were compromised by severe psoriasis or skin ulcers, were on the unit during the same period, and had oatmeal baths in a common bathtub. Of 50 staff members screened, the nurse was the only person detected as colonized by the strain. The other 3 patients on the unit as well as the 23 patients in other locations not associated with the outbreak had MRSA isolates with different RFA patterns. The use of the bathtub was discontinued and further transmission of MRSA was stopped.\n\nMake a scientific conclusion based on the given text above:assistant\n\nThe use of chromosomal typing of the MRSA isolates allowed for the rapid identification of the source of the outbreak and the characterization of the MRSA strain associated with the outbreak.

Prekallikrein levels tended to be elevated in all groups of hypertensive patients compared with controls whilst urinary kallikrein was significantly decreased in malignant hypertensives. The most pronounced suppression of urinary kallikrein was seen in the group of patients with essential malignant hypertension. The differences persisted when urinary kallikrein was related to the degree of renal impairment or when urinary volume was taken into account. There was no relation between family history of hypertension and low levels of urinary kallikrein.\n\nMake a scientific conclusion based on the given text above:assistant\n\nThe decreased urinary kallikrein excretion in malignant hypertension is independent of the underlying aetiology. The depressed urinary kallikrein excretion in malignant hypertension may be a marker of the disease.", "answer": "Decreased urinary kallikrein could indicate depressed activity in the renal kallikrein-kinin system, which may be associated with the initiation of essential malignant hypertension."}

At least one probe was informative in 27 of the 33 subjects born with 50% risk, but the most informative probe (pi 227) was the one with the highest recombination rate (10%). Flanking markers were informative in only four of the 33 subjects.\n\nMake a scientific conclusion based on the given text above:assistant\n\nDNA analysis can be used to estimate the risk of familial adenomatous polyposis in some families. The most informative probe is pi 227. However, the high recombination rate associated with this probe means that the use of DNA analysis will not be a routine method of risk assessment.", "answer": "These findings confirm the potential for accurate predictive diagnosis of familial adenomatous polyposis with polymorphic DNA probes, but such an approach is currently limited to about one third of affected families. A combined approach to presymptomatic diagnosis, which includes DNA testing and indirect ophthalmoscopy, is advocated."}

Retrospective review and analysis of 203 consecutive procedures. Washington University Lung Transplantation Program, Washington University School of Medicine and Barnes Hospital, St. Louis, Mo. Fifty-five lung transplant recipients. Biopsies were done with 2-mm fenestrated forceps using fluoroscopic guidance. Two hundred three bronchoscopies with transbronchial lung biopsy were performed for clinical indications (n = 88), routine surveillance (n = 90), or follow-up of a previous biopsy (n = 25). Biopsy specimens showing acute allograft rejection were classified according to the scheme recommended by the Lung Rejection Study Group. The positivity rate and complication rate were determined for the procedures. In procedures performed for clinical indications, the sensitivity for the diagnosis of acute rejection and cytomegalovirus pneumonia was calculated by a decision-to-treat analysis. A specific histologic diagnosis was detected in 69 percent of the clinical procedures, 57 percent of the surveillance procedures, and 64 percent of the follow-up procedures. For clinical indications, the sensitivity of transbronchial lung biopsy was 72 percent for the diagnosis of acute rejection and 91 percent for the diagnosis of cytomegalovirus pneumonia.

Significant RAS was assumed if lateralization of renal vein renin to the stenotic side was proven. The pulsatility index was higher in the hypertensives without RAS than in normal volunteers. Side differences between both kidneys were within methodological variations with the exception of one case, in whom side difference was > 0.12.

They were studied at our clinical research center. Skeletal radiographs documented progressive generalized osteosclerosis. Increased bone mass was confirmed by dual-energy radiography, and bone scintigraphy showed diffusely increased radionuclide accumulation. Serum biochemical studies revealed elevated alkaline phosphatase activity and osteocalcin levels, mild to moderately increased 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D concentrations, and normal parathyroid hormone levels.

A 28-year-old white woman and a 38-year-old black man with a history of non-A, non-B chronic active hepatitis were referred to us for increasing bone pain that was especially severe in their lower extremities. They were studied at our clinical research center. Skeletal radiographs documented progressive generalized osteosclerosis. Increased bone mass was confirmed by dual-energy radiography, and bone scintigraphy showed diffusely increased radionuclide accumulation. Serum biochemical studies revealed elevated alkaline phosphatase activity and osteocalcin levels, mild to moderately increased 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D concentrations, and normal parathyroid hormone levels. In urine, hydroxyproline excretion was elevated, whereas calcium levels were reduced. Iliac crest histomorphometry showed increased rates of bone formation. Hematology, renal function, serum protein electrophoresis, and screening for fluorosis as well as vitamin A and heavy metal poisoning were all normal. Family histories were negative. Both patients were seropositive for antibody against hepatitis C virus as well as against Epstein-Barr virus (antiviral capsid antigen IgG but not IgM).

This enzyme is recognized as a primary target for cytotoxic activity of important antitumor agents. In this study, we attempted to determine if altered forms of DNA topoisomerase II are responsible for reduced drug sensitivity.

In 22 instances, more lesions were seen with FLAIR sequences, and, in the remaining 26, equal numbers were seen. In 42 lesions, conspicuity was better with FLAIR sequences, equal in five and worse in one cystic lesion. Lesion extent was better assessed in 28 of the 48 cases with FLAIR sequences and equally well seen in the remainder.\n\nMake a scientific conclusion based on the given text above:assistant\n\nFLAIR sequences have a number of advantages over conventional spin-echo sequences. They have better lesion conspicuity, are more sensitive to lesions, and provide better assessment of lesion extent.", "answer": "By virtue of their long echo time and relative freedom from cerebrospinal fluid artifact FLAIR sequences provide high sensitivity to a wide range of disease. The basic sequence is easy to implement but is relatively time consuming."}

Venous samples were drawn every 4 h for 24 h and hormone levels were assessed with specific radioimmunoassays. The blood pressure was measured every 15 min with a SpaceLabs 90207 monitor. The mean 24-h plasma CGRP concentrations were significantly lower in the hypertensive group than in the control group. In both groups a circadian rhythm was present with the same pattern, but at a lower level in hypertension. A temporal sequence starting with the nocturnal rise in plasma CGRP concentrations and progressing with the elevations of ANP, PRA, and plasma aldosterone and cortisol was apparent in both groups. The nocturnal rise in the CGRP and ANP concentrations coincided with the blood pressure and the heart rate falls.\n\nMake a scientific conclusion based on the given text above:assistant\n\nThese results suggest that CGRP, like ANP, may be involved in the regulation of the blood pressure in the long-term.", "answer": "Our data show that CGRP is lower than normal but maintains its circadian variability and its relationship with the diurnal variations in blood pressure and other hormones known to be active on the cardiovascular system."}

Interactions of prostasomes with neutrophils and monocytes inhibits their ability to phagocytose latex particles. The ability to ingest opsonized bacteria is, however, not impaired. Our results also show that incubation of leukocytes with prostasomes effectively inhibits superoxide anion generation in response to activation by PMA and FMLP.\n\nMake a scientific conclusion based on the given text above:assistant\n\nThese results suggest that prostasomes may play a role in the regulation of leukocyte function in the male genital tract.", "answer": "Prostasomes may play a complementary role to other immunosuppressive factors contained in the human semen. They may protect sperm cells from deleterious effects of phagocytosing cells, prolong their life, and consequently enhance the chance of conception. At the same time prostasomes may have a permissive effect on sexually transmitted diseases."}

The absence of a correlation between the two traits also indicates that alterations in platelet function in essential hypertension, often found in population-based studies, may have to be reaffirmed in genetically better-defined situations, e.g. by pedigree analysis."}

One hundred fifty-seven specimens from 87 patients, infected or non-infected with human immunodeficiency virus, were examined for the presence of P. carinii. Specimens were either induced sputum samples or bronchoalveolar lavage fluids. Indirect immunofluorescence was performed with six stable clones obtained by limiting dilution. Four of the monoclonal antibodies were IgG1 isotypes, one was an IgG3 and one was an IgM. Their isoelectric points varied from 6.5 to 8.3. Tests were also performed with silver methenamine staining and with two commercially available monoclonal antibodies (Monofluo kit from Diagnostics Pasteur and MAb from Dako). The 6 antibodies all recognized P. carinii cysts in indirect immunofluorescence. No cross reactivity was observed with yeast or host cells. P. carinii antigens could not be identified with western immunoblotting suggesting that the monoclonal antibodies recognized native antigens. This result was confirmed by dot blot analysis. Spots were observed with native but not with denatured antigens. Inhibition studies showed that these 6 antibodies recognized the same or overlapping sites. The sensitivities of detection of P. carinii in sputum were 87% by silver stain and from 93.5 to 96.7% by immunofluorescence. The sensitivities of detection in bronchoalveolar lavage were 67.3% by silver stain and from 75.7% to 76.8% by immunofluorescence.\n\nMake a scientific conclusion based on the given text above:assistant\n\nThe 6 monoclonal antibodies are useful tools for the diagnosis of P. carinii pneumonia.

Since the activation of leukocytes depends on the action of cytokines, mainly tumour necrosis factor (TNF), we evaluated TNF secretion during myocardial infarction. The study included 12 patients with acute myocardial infarction as diagnosed on the basis of enzymatic and ECG criteria. Patients were admitted within 3 hours from onset of chest pain.

For CM, the most prevalent headache locations were frontal (81%) and occipital (78%). Neck pain and upper back pain accompanied headache in 90% and 41% of subjects, respectively. For MCH, the most prevalent headache locations were occipital (87%) and frontal (81%). Neck and upper back pain accompanied headache in 100% and 27%, respectively, of all subjects. For the total group, 77% of all subjects and 89% of females exhibited a marked reduction, absence or reversal of the normal cervical lordosis. Ninety-seven percent of all subjects exhibited, on dynamic X-ray studies, at least one significant abnormality of segmental mobility from C1 to C7, while 43% exhibited abnormalities at four or more segments.

TSH-secreting pituitary adenomas are treated with surgery and, if necessary, adjuvant pituitary radiotherapy. The results are generally good if the tumor is diagnosed and treated at an early stage. Primary therapy for hyperthyroidism due to selective pituitary resistance to thyroid hormone is aimed at suppression of pituitary TSH hypersecretion. The evaluation of any patient with hyperthyroidism must be thorough and, in some cases, should include measurement of TSH to determine the presence of inappropriate secretion. Eliminating this diagnosis will help avoid improper and potentially harmful treatment of hyperthyroid patients."}

Binding experiments with 3H-prazosin revealed no differences in density or affinity for cardiac tissues from SHR and WKY rats.\n\nMake a scientific conclusion based on the given text above:assistant\n\nThe results of the present study indicate that the hypertrophic process in SHR does not affect the functional responses of the beta-adrenoceptors. The inotropic response to alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonists was significantly weaker in SHR than in WKY rat hearts. This decrease in response to alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonists in SHR may be a reflection of the lower density of alpha 1-adrenoceptors in SHR rat hearts.", "answer": "Long-standing hypertension leads to an impaired response of the isolated heart to alpha 1-adrenoceptor stimulation, without changes in alpha 1-receptor density or affinity. It seems likely that changes in postreceptor events are responsible for the impaired inotropic response to alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonists in hearts from SHR."}

{"input": "Cats naturally infected with feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) are particularly susceptible to infection with opportunistic pathogens, suggesting that these animals are unable to develop an effective immune response against the pathogen. Previous studies have used CD4+:CD8+ lymphocyte ratios and mitogen blastogenesis to identify immunological abnormalities in FIV-infected cats. However, these studies provide limited information for understanding the nature of the cellular dysfunction in FIV-infected cats, particularly defects in antigen-specific immune responses. To investigate whether cats infected with FIV are less able to mount an immune response to previously unencountered antigens, we compared the development of antigen-specific cellular immunity at the stage of T-cell priming in uninfected and FIV-infected cats. The general immune status of cats was assessed by peripheral blood CD4+:CD8+ lymphocyte ratios (flow cytometry), and by lymphocyte blastogenesis response to T- and B-cell mitogens. In addition, we describe the development of an autologous culture system to measure specific priming of naive feline T-cells to soluble antigen in vitro. This assay was used to compare T-cell priming in uninfected cats and cats which had been infected with FIV for 6-27 months. As in HIV infection, CD4+:CD8+ lymphocyte ratios in FIV-infected cats were found to be inverted, due to a reduction in the percentage of CD4+ cells. In addition, lymphocyte blastogenesis to both T- and B-cell mitogens was significantly impaired in FIV-infected cats. Priming to keyhole limpet haemocyanin (KLH) elicited a late proliferative response resulting from the expansion of CD4+ (T-helper cells). T-cell growth factor secretion correlated with cell proliferation. Restimulation of cells with fresh antigen-presenting cells and antigen showed that antigen-specific T-cell priming had occurred in the initial culture. When primary proliferation responses in FIV-infected cats were examined, it was observed that naive CD4+ T-cells from FIV-infected cats were significantly impaired (P less than 0.001) in their ability to be primed to KLH when compared with uninfected controls.\n\nMake a scientific conclusion based on the given text above:", "output": "These results suggest that the immune dysfunction in FIV-infected cats is not limited to defects in lymphocyte activation, but includes impaired priming of naive T-cells to previously unencountered antigens.", "output_with_context": "user\n\nCats naturally infected with feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) are particularly susceptible to infection with opportunistic pathogens, suggesting that these animals are unable to develop an effective immune response against the pathogen.

In four patients, whose mean duration of nightmares was 23 years, the nightmares ceased.\n\nMake a scientific conclusion based on the given text above:assistant\n\nThese results show that chronic nightmares can be treated effectively by a single session of instructions.", "answer": "The results of this preliminary study suggests that the instructions given to the patients reduced the frequency of their chronic nightmares and decreased their self-rated distress."}
{"input": "To determine the frequency of HLA class I and II antigens in Caucasian North American patients with Takayasu arteritis (TA). Seventy-three class I antigens and 13 class II antigens were examined in 21 Caucasian North American patients with TA, and their frequencies were compared with findings in 243 healthy, untreated controls. HLA typing was performed by microlymphocytotoxicity assay. We found no statistically significant positive association of TA with DR2, DR4, DQw3, or any of the other class I or class II antigens studied. A negative association between TA and DR1 was noted. There was no significant association between any of the HLA antigens and the severity of the disease or the presence of complications.\n\nMake a scientific conclusion based on the given text above:", "output": "The frequency of HLA class I and II antigens in Caucasian North American patients with TA is not significantly different from that in healthy, untreated controls. The negative association of TA with DR1 is of interest and requires further study.", "output_with_context": "user\n\nTo determine the frequency of HLA class I and II antigens in Caucasian North American patients with Takayasu arteritis (TA).
