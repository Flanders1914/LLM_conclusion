It usually occurs between the ages of 40 and 60 years , and is associated with hormonal , physical , and psychological changes . Estrogen and progesterone levels play the biggest part in menopause . In this stage , the ovaries make less estrogen and progesterone . When the body produces less of these hormones , the parts of the body that depend on estrogen to keep them healthy will react and this often causes discomfort for women . This study tested the impact of a complementary health approach to quality of life in menopausal women . A community-based interventional study was conducted in selected areas in Kattankulathur Block , Kanchipuram District , Tamil Nadu , India . A simple random sampling technique was used to select menopausal women for the study . Of 260 menopausal women identified , 130 were allocated to a study group and 130 to a control group . The study group underwent yoga training for 1.5 hours per day on 5 consecutive days . After the 5-day intensive yoga training program , the menopausal women practiced yoga daily at home for 35-40 minutes a day . Along with daily yoga practice , they underwent group yoga practice for 2 days a week under the supervision of one of the investigators until 18 weeks . The yoga training program consisted of Yogasanas , Pranayama ( breathing exercises ) , and meditation . The standardized World Health Organization QoL BREF scale was used to assess the women 's quality of life . We distributed an instruction manual on steps of selected yoga practice for the women 's self-reference at home after the 5 days of continuous yoga practice . A yoga practice diary was used to confirm regular performance of yoga . The women in the control group did not participate in the yoga program ; however , on completion of the study , these women received intensive yoga training for 5 days . There was an extremely high statistically significant difference ( P = 0.001 ) between the study group and the control group with regard to the physical , psychological , social , and environmental domains of quality of life after 6 , 12 , and 18 weeks of yoga therapy .

It usually occurs between the ages of 40 and 60 years, and is associated with hormonal, physical, and psychological changes. Estrogen and progesterone levels play the biggest part in menopause. In this stage, the ovaries make less estrogen and progesterone. When the body produces less of these hormones, the parts of the body that depend on estrogen to keep them healthy will react and this often causes discomfort for women. This study tested the impact of a complementary health approach to quality of life in menopausal women. A community-based interventional study was conducted in selected areas in Kattankulathur Block, Kanchipuram District, Tamil Nadu, India. A simple random sampling technique was used to select menopausal women for the study. Of 260 menopausal women identified, 130 were allocated to a study group and 130 to a control group. The study group underwent yoga training for 1.5 hours per day on 5 consecutive days. After the 5-day intensive yoga training program, the menopausal women practiced yoga daily at home for 35-40 minutes a day. Along with daily yoga practice, they underwent group yoga practice for 2 days a week under the supervision of one of the investigators until 18 weeks. The yoga training program consisted of Yogasanas, Pranayama ( breathing exercises ), and meditation. The standardized World Health Organization QoL BREF scale was used to assess the women's quality of life. We distributed an instruction manual on steps of selected yoga practice for the women's self-reference at home after the 5 days of continuous yoga practice. A yoga practice diary was used to confirm regular performance of yoga. The women in the control group did not participate in the yoga program ; however, on completion of the study, these women received intensive yoga training for 5 days. There was an extremely high statistically significant difference ( P = 0.001 ) between the study group and the control group with regard to the physical, psychological, social, and environmental domains of quality of life after 6, 12, and 18 weeks of yoga therapy. The mean gain score was high in all the domains of quality of life in the study group at weeks 6, 12, and 18. The overall mean gain score in the study group was 31.58 versus 1.61 in the control group.

Each group received a 10mg/mL posterior subtenon injection of nanoparticle carboplatin in the eye to be enucleated. Two eyes were enucleated 6, 24 and 72 hours post injection. Intravenous blood was collected during enucleation. The concentration of carboplatin reaching various intraocular tissues was determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy. The drug toxicity in the ocular tissues was assessed by histopathology and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. The highest level of carboplatin was detected in retinas ( 8.33 1.69 mg/g ), up to 24 hours post treatment. The intravitreal concentration continued to increase gradually until 72 hours ( 3.46 0.26 mg/g ). The choroids and lenses showed very low levels of carboplatin after 6 hours, with negligible amounts at 72 hours. No signs of tissue damage were observed on histopathology or electron microscopy. Intravenous concentration of carboplatin was undetectable in all patients.\n\nMake a scientific conclusion based on the given text above:assistant\n\nPosterior subtenon injection of nanoparticles loaded with carboplatin is safe and a promising drug delivery system for the treatment of retinal diseases.", "answer": "Results may indicate an increased facilitated trans-scleral transport of nanoparticle carboplatin , with a sustained-release behavior but without any associated short-term ocular or systemic side effects in humans . The very high concentrations achieved in vitreous and retina after a single posterior subtenon injection may be clinically useful for adjunctive treatment of advanced intraocular retinoblastoma with vitreous seeds . However , further studies are needed to assess long-term toxicity andclinical efficacy ."}

Both cohorts received maintenance fluids consisting in isotonic crystalloids and albumin in case of severe hypoalbuminemia ( < 2 g/dL ) . Exclusion criteria included previous fluid therapy , pregnancy , brain death , extended burns , chronic hemodialysis or liver disease , known coagulopathy , acute anaphylaxis , dehydration and hypotension due to sedative drugs .

Recent studies have questioned the administration of colloid-based solutions, especially if containing hydroxyethyl starch ( HES ), in different ICU populations ; however, there is still uncertainty on the use of colloids as initial fluid therapy for early resuscitation. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of two different resuscitation fluid strategies on the mortality of patients with shock. In a multicentric ( 57 ICUs ), controlled, open-label trial ( from February 2003 to August 2012 ), the authors randomized patients with signs of acute hypovolemia, defined by the combination of hypotension, evidence of low filling pressures or cardiac index and at least two signs of tissue hypoperfusion ( such as altered consciousness, mottled skin, oliguria, lactate levels > 2 mmol/L ), to received either a colloid - or crystalloid-based therapy. Both cohorts received maintenance fluids consisting in isotonic crystalloids and albumin in case of severe hypoalbuminemia ( < 2 g/dL ). Exclusion criteria included previous fluid therapy, pregnancy, brain death, extended burns, chronic hemodialysis or liver disease, known coagulopathy, acute anaphylaxis, dehydration and hypotension due to sedative drugs. Among the 6498 eligible patients, 2857 were eventually randomized in one of the two groups. The 28-day mortality was 25.4 % in the colloid and 27.0 % in the crystalloid group ( P = 0.26 ). In the sub-group analysis, similar mortality rates were reported for shock due to hypovolemia, sepsis or trauma. Also, the use of continuous renal replacement therapy was similar between groups ( 11.0 % vs. 12.5 %, P = 0.19 ).

The DASH diet was rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains and low-fat dairy products, and contained lower amounts of saturated fats, cholesterol and refined grains with a total of 2400 mg/day sodium. The numbers of women who commenced insulin therapy after dietary intervention, the mode of delivery and prevalence of polyhydramnios were assessed. The length, weight and head circumference of infants were measured during the first 24 h after birth. Whereas 46.2 % of women in the DASH diet needed to have a cesarean section, this percentage for the control group was 80.8 % ( P = 0.01 ). The percentage of those who needed to commence insulin therapy after intervention was also significantly different between the two groups ( 23 % for DASH vs 73 % for control group, P < 0.0001 ). Infants born to mothers on the DASH diet had significantly lower weight ( 3222.7 vs 3818.8 g, P < 0.0001 ), head circumference ( 34.2 vs 35.1 cm, P = 0.01 ) and ponderal index ( 2.50 vs 2.87 kg/m ( 3 ), P < 0.0001 ) compared with those born to mothers on the control diet.\n\nMake a scientific conclusion based on the given text above:assistant\n\nThe DASH diet may be beneficial in improving pregnancy outcomes in women with GDM.", "answer": "In conclusion , consumption of DASH diet for 4 weeks among pregnant women with GDM resulted in improved pregnancy outcomes ."}

In this double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial, 80 students with PMS residing at dormitories of Jahrom University of Medical Sciences were divided randomly into two groups, vitamin B1 and placebo. The severity of the symptoms of PMS in two cycles, before the intervention and during the intervention, was recorded by the students. The data were collected using an information collection form, PMS provisional diagnosis form, daily status record form, Beck Depression Inventory. The data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. There was no significant difference among the studied variables in terms of confounding variables. The comparison of vitamin B1 group before the intervention with that after the intervention showed that vitamin B1 reduced mean mental ( 35.08 % ) and physical ( 21.2 % ) symptoms significantly ( P < 0.0001 ). Moreover, there was a significant difference between vitamin B1 and placebo groups in terms of mean mental and physical symptoms, as mean symptoms in vitamin B1 group was significantly lower than that in the placebo group ( P < 0.0001 ).\n\nMake a scientific conclusion based on the given text above:assistant\n\nVitamin B1 is effective in reducing symptoms of PMS in students residing at dormitories of Jahrom University of Medical Sciences. It can be used as a safe and effective drug for the treatment of PMS.", "answer": "It seems that vitamin B1 is effective in recovery of mental and physical symptoms of PMS .

In the latter group, patients who underwent therapy for a longer time had tubal complications ( p < 0.05 ) and longer intensive care unit and hospital stays ( p < 0.05 ).\n\nMake a scientific conclusion based on the given text above:assistant\n\nThe two enteral access routes were similar in terms of early initiation of enteral therapy and the length of use. However, patients with NE tubes required parenteral therapy more frequently, and they had more complications related to the enteral route. The use of a jejunostomy was associated with a longer intensive care unit and hospital stay, especially in patients who used the tube for a longer time.", "answer": "The two enteral routes were associated with the same number of complications . However , the presence of a jejunostomy allowed enteral therapy for longer periods , especially in patients with complications , thus avoiding the need for parenteral nutrition ."}

At 12 months 77.8 % of those receiving desmopressin and 75 % of those treated with enuretic alarm had success. However, long-term success rate was significantly higher with desmopressin ( 68.8 % vs 46.2 % ) if intention to treat population was considered. Multivariate analysis revealed treatment group, severity of enuresis and monthly income as independent predictors of cure at 6 months.\n\nMake a scientific conclusion based on the given text above:assistant\n\nDesmopressin is superior to enuretic alarm therapy for the treatment of primary monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis in children.", "answer": "In compliant patients desmopressin lyophilisate and enuretic alarm provided equivalent success at the end of treatment and after extended followup . Alarm therapy had a high rate of early withdrawal from therapy and consequently lower rates of success on intention to treat analyses . Severe enuresis ( more than 5 wet nights weekly ) is an important predictive factor for cure after first-line treatment ."}

We tested with univariate and adjusted models the association of single measurements of presepsin or changes over time with clinical events, organ dysfunctions, appropriateness of antibiotic therapy, and ICU or 90-day mortality. Presepsin concentration at baseline ( 946 [ 492-1,887 ] ng/L ) increased with the SOFA score, the number of prevalent organ dysfunctions or failures, and the incidence of new failures of the respiratory, coagulation, liver, and kidney systems. The concentration decreased in ICU over 7 days in patients with negative blood cultures, and in those with positive blood cultures and appropriate antibiotic therapy ; it increased with inappropriate antibiotic therapy ( p = 0.0009 ).

One investigator followed each subject to record time and triage assignment. All subjects completed a post-test survey and structured interview following the simulated disaster. Forty-three paramedics were enrolled. Seventeen were assigned to the SALT group with an overall triage accuracy of 66 % 15 %, an overtriage mean rate of 22 16 %, and an undertriage rate of 10 9 %. Twenty-six participants were assigned to the JumpSTART group with an overall accuracy of 66 12 %, an overtriage mean of 23 16 %, and an undertriage rate of 11.2 11 %. Ease of use was not statistically different between the two systems ( median Likert value of both systems = 2, p = 0.39 ) Time to triage per patient was statistically faster in the JumpSTART group ( SALT = 34 23 seconds, JumpSTART = 26 19 seconds, p = 0.02 ). Both systems were prone to cognitive and affective error.\n\nMake a scientific conclusion based on the given text above:assistant\n\nSALT and JumpSTART were equally accurate in triage accuracy. SALT was faster to triage than JumpSTART. Paramedics in both groups were prone to cognitive and affective error. Both systems should be considered for use in a pediatric MCI.", "answer": "SALT appears to be at least as good as JumpSTART in overall triage accuracy , overtriage , or undertriage rates in a simulated pediatric MCI . Both systems were considered easy to use . However , JumpSTART was 8 seconds faster per patient in time taken to assign triage designations ."}

In each case, the experimental drugs were found to be ineffective, permitting assessment of the EXACT's performance in three independent studies of moderate to severe high-risk patients on maintenance therapies. The mean age of subjects was 62 to 64 years ; 48 to 76 % were male. Mean FEV1 % predicted was 42 to 59 %. EXACT scores exhibited internal consistency ( Cronbach's 0.90 ), reproducibility ( intraclass correlation 0.70 ), correlation with St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire ( Spearman rho [ rs ] = 0.62, 0.46, 0.46 in the three trials ; P < 0.001 ), and Breathlessness Cough and Sputum Scale ( AZ 1, rs = 0.83 ; AZ 2, rs = 0.83 ; P < 0.001 ). EXACT-defined events had a high correspondence with alternative indicators of worsening ( 94, 88, and 93 % ). In each trial, unreported events were similar in severity ( mean EXACT score, 56, 57, 61 vs. 53, 54 [ P < 0.05 ], 57 [ P < 0.05 ], respectively ; 100-point scale ) and longer ( median, 9, 8, 7 vs. 8, 7 [ P < 0.01 ], 6 days, respectively ) than moderate MTEs.\n\nMake a scientific conclusion based on the given text above:assistant\n\nThe EXACT's performance in three independent, randomized controlled trials was consistent with previous findings. The tool is a robust, patient-reported outcome measure that can be used to standardize the symptomatic assessment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations, including reported and unreported events.", "answer": "Data generated through the EXACT offers insight into the symptomatic nature of MTEs and the frequency , severity , and duration of unreported symptom-defined events .

The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of second-generation e-cigs both in terms of acute craving-reduction in the lab and in terms of smoking reduction and experienced benefits/complaints in an eight-month Randomized Controlled Trial ( RCT ). RCT with three arms. Participants ( N = 48 ) unwilling to quit smoking were randomized into two e-cig groups and one control group. During three lab sessions ( over two months ) participants, who had been abstinent for four hours, vaped/smoked for five minutes, after which we monitored the effect on craving and withdrawal symptoms. eCO and saliva cotinine levels were also measured.

The groups were homogeneous for age, BMI, male/female ratio, and diabetic or smoker patients. The mean hospital stay was significantly longer in group A than in group B. We found eight cases of serum collection > 20 cc in group A and only one case in group B. Hematoma, umbilicus necrosis, and surgical site infection occurred in both groups, but overall complication rate was lower in group B.\n\nMake a scientific conclusion based on the given text above:assistant\n\nThe application of fibrin glue under the abdominal flap in obese patients undergoing a lipo-abdominoplasty reduces the incidence of seroma.", "answer": "The use of a fibrin glue with a low concentration of thrombin could be useful during wound closure and may decrease seroma formation in postbariatric patients undergoing lipo-abdominoplasty ."}

HBV-specific T-cell responses were induced in a portion of patients in medium to high dose of HB-110. Interestingly, HB-110 exhibited positive effects on ALT normalization and maintenance of HBeAg seroconversion. One patient, who received high dose of HB-110 exhibited HBeAg seroconversion during vaccination, which correlated with vaccine-induced T-cell responses without ALT elevation.\n\nMake a scientific conclusion based on the given text above:assistant\n\nThe present study suggests that HB-110 is safe and immunogenic in mice and patients with CHB.", "answer": "HB-110 was safe and tolerable in CHB patients . In contrast to results in animal models , HB-110 in Korean patients exhibited weaker capability of inducing HBV-specific T-cell responses and HBeAg seroconversion than HB-100 in Caucasian patients . As Asian patients , who are generally infected via vertical transmission , appeared to have higher level of immune tolerance than Caucasian , novel approaches for breaking immune tolerance rather than enhancing immunogenicity may be more urgently demanded to develop effective therapeutic HBV DNA vaccines ."}

Particular attention was given to special-interests groups ( eg, Jehovah Witnesses, homeless ) and to Spanish-speaking communities ( brochures and presentations in Spanish ). Opt-out materials were available during on-site presentations or via the COMBAT study website. A total of 227 community organizations were contacted. Brochures were distributed to 11 medical clinics and 3 homeless shelters. The multimedia campaign had the potential to reach an estimated audience of 1.5 million individuals in large metro Denver area, the majority via one-way communication and 1900 in two-way communications. This resource intensive process cost more than $ 84,000.\n\nMake a scientific conclusion based on the given text above:assistant\n\nThe CC/PD process is labor-intensive and costly.

The 13 % difference in costs between study arms predominantly originated from costs of RBC units, as costs of RBC units were six times higher in the RBC transfusion arm. RBC transfusion led to a small improvement in physical fatigue of 058 points per day ; thus, the costs to improve the physical fatigue score with one point would be 431.\n\nMake a scientific conclusion based on the given text above:assistant\n\nRBC transfusion is cost-effective compared to non-intervention in women with postpartum haemorrhage and acute anaemia without severe anaemic symptoms.", "answer": "In women with acute anaemia after postpartum haemorrhage ( PPH ) , RBC transfusion is on average 249 more expensive per woman than non-intervention , with only a small gain in HRQoL after RBC transfusion . Taking both clinical and economic consequences into account , implementation of a non-intervention policy seems justified ."}

After debonding, all specimens were analyzed using SEM to categorize the failure modes. The data were statistically analyzed using 3-way ANOVA and Tukey's tests ( = 0.05 ). Significant effects of the FRC type ( S2 or E-glass ) ( p < 0.01 ), resin type ( PFC or FR ) ( p < 0.01 ) and polymerization protocol ( p < 0.05 ) were observed on the bond strength ( MPa ). Interaction terms were also significant ( p < 0.05 ). The multidirectional FRC groups ( g to l ) showed significantly lower bond strengths ( 2.3 0.2 to 7.3 0.3 MPa ) than did the unidirectional FRC groups ( a to f ) ( 10.7 0.6 to 24.4 0.8 MPa ). Among the unidirectional FRC groups, the highest values were obtained with protocol f ( 24.4 0.8 ), followed by protocol e ( 18.6 0.4 ). PFC adhesion to unidirectional FRC was lower when FRC and PFC were polymerized in one step ( protocol a : 11.3 0.5 ) than individual polymerization ( protocol c : 14.1 0.5 ). The opposite situation was true for FR ( protocol b : 17.5 0.4 ; protocol d : 10.7 0.6 ). Groups a to f presented exclusively mixed failures ( a combination of partial cohesive failure in the PFC and adhesive failure between the FRC and PFC ) and groups g to l demonstrated only adhesive failure ( intact FRC no cohesive failure of PFC ). TGA revealed 55 3 wt % fiber content for multidirectional and 60 3 wt % for unidirectional FRCs tested.\n\nMake a scientific conclusion based on the given text above:assistant\n\nPFC adhesion to unidirectional FRCs was higher when FRC and PFC were polymerized individually, whereas FR adhesion was higher when polymerized in one step. The highest bond strength was observed with the FR protocol. Mixed failures were observed in unidirectional FRCs. Adhesive failures were observed in multidirectional FRCs.", "answer": "Multidirectional pre-impregnated E-glass fibers can not be recommended in combination with the PFC and FR materials tested in this study . Application of an intermediate adhesive resin layer increases the adhesion of both PFC and FR to unidirectional FRC . FRC and FR can be polymerized in one step , but FRC and PFC combinations should be polymerized individually ."}

Variance analysis was used for repeating measurement to observe dynamic serum PCT level of the two groups of patients for survival and death during 7 days. Mann-Whitney U test or ( 2 ) test showed that there were no statistical significance in age, gender, APACHEII score, blood culture positive rate, sputum culture positive rate, cardiac insufficiency, renal failure, respiratory failure, and ventilator and hemofiltration usage ( all P > 0.05 ). Log Rank test results showed that the time of antimicrobial drug usage was significantly reduced in PCT group than that in RAT group [ days : 8.10.3, 95 % confidence interval ( 95 % CI 8.3-9.7 ) vs. 9.30.3 ( 95 % CI 8.7-10.1 ), P = 0.013 ]. Kaplan-Meier univariate survival curves showed that the speed of curve declination in PCT group was faster significantly than that in RAT group, suggesting that the time of using antimicrobial drug was shortened. There was no significant difference in length of hospital stay, ICU stay time, number of death in 28 days, number of cases of recurrence in 28 days and clinical cure rate between two groups ( all P > 0.05 ).

The trial had 19 years of registry-based follow-up and was analysed with Cox regression models. Repeated occurrences in the same patient of outcomes ( any diabetes-related endpoint, myocardial infarction [ MI ], stroke, peripheral vascular disease and microvascular disease ) were accounted for with the Wei, Lin and Weissfeld method. As previously shown, the intervention reduced the rates of first occurrence of both MI and any diabetes-related endpoint. However, for all outcomes, the HR for a second event showed a statistically non-significant tendency to be increased. We estimated a combined HR for all marginal failure times, regardless of whether they were first, second or later events. This showed that the intervention had no effect on the rate of any of the outcomes, including MI ( HR 0.89, 95 % CI 0.76, 1.05 ) and any diabetes-related endpoint ( HR 0.98, 95 % CI 0.87, 1.09 ).\n\nMake a scientific conclusion based on the given text above:assistant\n\nThe DCGP study demonstrated that the estimation of effect size in clinical trials of complex interventions may be biased by the estimation of effect size for recurrent outcomes.

Mean plasma glucose at 20 min after release of the hypoglycaemic clamp was significantly lower ( 3.1 0.3 mmol/l ) for AZD1656 alone than for AZD1656 + glucagon ( 4.9 0.8 mmol/l ; p < 0.001 between the groups ). Catecholamine and cortisol responses were similar on the AZD1656 + glucagon and AZD alone study days. Growth hormone response was 18 % lower for AZD1656 alone ( p = 0.01 ), consistent with the effect of a pharmacological dose of glucagon on growth hormone secretion. No safety or tolerability concerns were observed during treatment with AZ1656.\n\nMake a scientific conclusion based on the given text above:assistant\n\nExogenous glucagon was effective in preventing hypoglycaemia in patients with type 2 diabetes treated with metformin and a novel glucokinase activator, AZD1656.", "answer": "Exogenous glucagon was effective as a rescue treatment for hypoglycaemia induced during treatment with AZD1656 , given in combination with metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes ."}

Caspase-cleaved cytokeratin 18, a biomarker of apoptosis was also significantly elevated ( 1.7 fold ). A rise in glutamate dehydrogenase ( 7.3 fold ) may support mitochondrial dysfunction.\n\nMake a scientific conclusion based on the given text above:assistant\n\nThese results support the hypothesis that serum biomarkers of hepatotoxicity may be capable of distinguishing between elevations in serum ALT associated with cholestyramine treatment, which has never been associated with clinically relevant liver injury, and ALT elevations associated with serious liver injury.", "answer": "All toxicity biomarkers measured in this study were elevated along with ALT , confirming the liver origin and reflecting both hepatocyte necrosis and apoptosis . Since cholestyramine treatment has no clinical liver safety concerns , we conclude that interpretation of the biomarkers studied may not be straightforward in the context of assessing liver safety of new drugs ."}

RESULTS from previous studies evaluating the effects of sex steroids on plasma TG homeostasis are inconclusive because they relied on orally administered synthetic hormone preparations or evaluated only plasma lipid concentrations but not kinetics. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of systemically delivered 17-estradiol, progesterone, and T on very low density lipoprotein-triglyceride ( VLDL-TG ) concentration and kinetics in postmenopausal women. VLDL-TG concentration and kinetics were evaluated by using stable isotope-labeled tracer techniques in four groups of postmenopausal women ( n = 27 total ) who were studied before and after treatment with either 17-estradiol ( 0.1 mg/d via continuous delivery skin patch ), progesterone ( 100 mg/d via vaginal insert ) and T ( 12.5 mg/d via skin gel ), or no intervention ( control group ).

A swallow was defined as increased genioglossus activity with deglutition apnea and an increase in hypopharyngeal pressure. Spontaneous swallows were categorized as physiological ( during expiration or followed by expiration ) or pathological ( during inspiration or followed by an inspiration ). A total of 224 swallows were analyzed. Anesthesia increased the proportion of pathological swallows ( 25.9 % vs. 4.9 % ) and decreased the number of swallows per hour ( 1.73.3 vs. 28.022.3 ) compared to wakefulness. During anesthesia, hypercapnia decreased hypopharyngeal pressure during inspiration ( -14.13.7 vs. -8.72 mmHg ) and increased minute ventilation, the proportion of pathological swallows ( 19.1 % vs. 12.3 % ), and the number of swallows per hour ( 5.517.0. vs. 1.35.5 ).\n\nMake a scientific conclusion based on the given text above:assistant\n\nHypercapnia increases the number of swallows per hour and decreases hypopharyngeal pressure during inspiration. Hypercapnia may be useful in preventing aspiration of foreign material during general anesthesia.", "answer": "Anesthesia impaired the coordination between swallowing and respiration . Mild hypercapnia increased the frequency of swallowing during anesthesia and the likelihood of pathological swallowing .

This end point was assessed with the use of a Wilcoxon rank-sum test in which deaths were categorized as the lowest LVESVI rank. At 1 year, the mean LVESVI among surviving patients was 46.122.4 ml per square meter of body-surface area in the CABG-alone group and 49.631.5 ml per square meter in the combined-procedure group ( mean change from baseline, -9.4 and -9.3 ml per square meter, respectively ). The rate of death was 6.7 % in the combined-procedure group and 7.3 % in the CABG-alone group ( hazard ratio with mitral-valve repair, 0.90 ; 95 % confidence interval, 0.38 to 2.12 ; P = 0.81 ). The rank-based assessment of LVESVI at 1 year ( incorporating deaths ) showed no significant between-group difference ( z score, 0.50 ; P = 0.61 ). The addition of mitral-valve repair was associated with a longer bypass time ( P < 0.001 ), a longer hospital stay after surgery ( P = 0.002 ), and more neurologic events ( P = 0.03 ). Moderate or severe mitral regurgitation was less common in the combined-procedure group than in the CABG-alone group ( 11.2 % vs. 31.0 %, P < 0.001 ). There were no significant between-group differences in major adverse cardiac or cerebrovascular events, deaths, readmissions, functional status, or quality of life at 1 year.\n\nMake a scientific conclusion based on the given text above:assistant\n\nAmong patients with moderate ischemic mitral regurgitation, the addition of mitral-valve repair to CABG did not reduce left ventricular remodeling or improve clinical outcomes at 1 year.

Mitral-valve repair was associated with a reduced prevalence of moderate or severe mitral regurgitation but an increased number of untoward events . Thus , at 1 year , this trial did not show a clinically meaningful advantage of adding mitral-valve repair to CABG . Longer-term follow-up may determine whether the lower prevalence of mitral regurgitation translates into a net clinical benefit .

Exposure to televised food advertisements led to the completion of word stems with more food - and eating-related words in both experiments. It also increased self-reported desire to eat, but only for overweight and obese individuals ( Experiment 2 ). In both samples, there was a positive association between accessibility of food-related cognitions and reported desire to eat, following priming with television food advertisements.\n\nMake a scientific conclusion based on the given text above:assistant\n\nThese results suggest that exposure to television food advertising can increase the accessibility of food-related cognitions, which may in turn increase motivation to eat. The findings of this study provide initial support for the notion that exposure to television food advertising can have an immediate effect on the cognitive processes underlying eating behavior.", "answer": "We conclude that an increased activation of food-related cognitions may provide a mechanism for the link between food advertising and consumption . This has implications for tackling pathological ( over ) eating ."}

A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized pilot study was performed. Measurements were made in the laboratory at Mind-Body-Science ( Tucson, AZ, USA ). Participants collected some of the saliva samples at work or home. To obtain pilot data, 20 healthy individuals with no chronic conditions were recruited-5 males and 15 females-aged 30-69 y. Participants completed baseline psychological questionnaires and provided saliva samples for hormonal analysis. The next day, fingertip microvascular perfusion was measured, LEE or placebo patches were applied to participants'wrists, and perfusion scans were repeated, first immediately after and then 10 min after application of the patch. Saliva samples were collected, and questionnaires were completed. Participants returned at noon and 4:00 PM for further scans, and at the end of that time, the patches were removed. The protocol was repeated the following day using new patches. The research team analyzed the saliva samples for levels of cortisol and measured the percentage changes in cutaneous microvascular perfusion. The participants completed the energy visual analog scales ( eVASs ) and the Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability survey. After the first patch application, the active group showed significantly higher cortisol concentrations than the placebo group, both at noon-2.39 0.17 ng/mL vs 2.15 0.27 ( P =.0360 ), respectively-and at 4:00 PM - 2.02 0.24 vs 1.67 0.31 ( P =.0155 ), respectively. No consistent changes occurred in perfusion. The eVAS score decreased significantly compared with baseline in the placebo group but not in the active group.\n\nMake a scientific conclusion based on the given text above:assistant\n\nThis pilot study suggests that LEE patches may affect cortisol concentrations.

GEM Premier 3000 blood gas analyzer was used to analyze levels of the arterial oxygen ( CaO2 ), internal jugular venous oxygen ( CjvO2 ), arterio-venous oxygen content difference ( Da-jvO2 ) and cerebral oxygen ( CERO2 ) uptake rates of blood samples before controlled hypotension ( T0 ), 20 min after controlled hypotension ( T ). 40 min after controlled hypotension ( T2 ) and 20 min after the end of controlled hypotension ( T3 ). Self-comparison of each group showed that in comparison with pre-controlled hypotension, CjvO2 levels at the time-points of T, T2 and T3 were significantly increased in both GA control and TEAS+GA groups ( P < 0.05 ), while Da-jvO2 and CERO2 uptake rate levels at the time-points of T,. T2 and T3 in these two groups were significantly decreased ( P < 0.05 ). Comparison between two groups showed that CivO2 levels at the time-points of T2 and T3 were significantly higher in the TEAS + GA group than in the GA control group ( P < 0.05 ). while Da-jvO2 and CERO2 uptake rate levels at the time-point of T2 were obviously lower in the TEAS + GA group than in the GA control group ( P < 0.05 ), suggesting a reduction of cerebral oxygen consumption after TEAS. No significant differences were found between these two groups in blood CjvO2, Da-jvO2 and CERO2 uptake rate levels at the time-points of T0 and T1 ( P > 0.05 ).\n\nMake a scientific conclusion based on the given text above:assistant\n\nTEAS can effectively reduce cerebral oxygen consumption and promote cerebral oxygenation during hip replacement operation under general anesthesia with controlled hypotension, which may be a new method for the prevention of cerebral hypoxia.", "answer": "TEAS can reduce cerebral oxygen uptake rate in elderly patients undergoing hip replacement during controlled hypotension , suggesting a protective effect of TEAS on patient 's cerebral tissue ."}
